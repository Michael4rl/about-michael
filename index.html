       Hello. My name is Michael. I recently was cast as Hammerhead; the new villain in the next Marvel movie. I play
       the arch-enemy of Spider-man.  This is a picture of us in an epic battle.

    <p class="barkaroo">
        On my spare time I skydive with my dog named Captain Bark-a-roo. This is us on our last jump. Doesn't he look
        cute?
